PyAlgoViz
=========

This is a repository for all the code I have written as a part of my contributions to http://pyalgoviz.appspot.com/ 

PyAlgoViz is an HTML5 browser application that allows Python students and practitioners to prototype an algorithm, visualize it, replay the execution, and share the end-result with others. Main usage is in the Datastructures and Algorithm track of the Computer Science curriculum.


Background History
=====================

My colleague [Chris Laffra](http://www.chrislaffra.com/) created this very cool site during in fall of 2013. It eventually helped him move to his well deserving role in Google. I am the first and few of the early contributors to this site. I have created most of the examples by templating from other examples (even the visualization code) on the site. The site uses D3.js to generate the visualization part. 

Also checkout this cool [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poQKuXgNd88) from the author of this site at Facebook. He used some of my examples there.
