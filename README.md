About PyAlgoViz
================

My colleague Chris Laffra created this very cool site during in fall of 2013. It eventually helped him move to his well deserving role in Google. I am the first and few of the early contributors to this site. I have created most of the examples by templating from other examples (even the visualization code) on the site. The site uses D3.js to generate the visualization part. 

Also checkout this cool video from the author of this site at Facebook. He used some of my examples there.
